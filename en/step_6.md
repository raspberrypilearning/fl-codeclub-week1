## How to register with Code Club

If you’d like to get involved, the first step is to register on the Code Club website.

During the registration process, you will be asked for a **safeguarding sponsor**. This is an additional person at your school, venue, or organisation who will work with you to ensure that young people are safe. It is worth thinking about who your safeguarding sponsor will be before you start the registration process.

### Registering with Code Club in the UK, Ireland, India or the USA.

If you are based in the UK, Ireland, India or the USA, head to the Code Club website at [codeclub.org](https://www.codeclub.org/) to get started.

If you do not live in the UK, Ireland, India or the USA, the website is different — please see below.

### Registering with Code Club around the world (all areas apart from the UK, Ireland, India and the USA)

If you are registering a Code Club and you are *not* based in the UK, Ireland, India or the USA, head to the Code Club International website at [international.codeclub.org](http://international.codeclub.org) to find out more.

### Teachers and educators
Start by signing up and registering the details of your club.

You are now a club organiser! As the club organiser, you will act as the club administrator. You'll be able to add volunteers to your club, or you could choose to run the club yourself.

The club organiser is in charge of making sure that the club has the right insurance and equipment — we'll be explaining the equipment you need later in this week of the course.

They are also responsible for safeguarding the young people who attend the club and for ensuring that the club is a safe environment for them.

Your club has a dedicated club page where you can update the details of people running the club and add information about your club. If you are looking for a volunteer, you can add the day and time of your club sessions, and details about the venue, to your club page to encourage volunteers to get in touch and offer to help.

### Volunteers
The first step is to set up an account on our site. Next, you can search in your local area for a club looking for a volunteer, get in touch and offer to help.

As the volunteer, you will be there to facilitate the Code Club sessions and to assist the club members in using the Code Club projects to create animations, games, and webpages with code.
