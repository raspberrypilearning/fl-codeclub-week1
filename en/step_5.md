## What do I need to know to be a Code Club volunteer?


You absolutely don't need to be a developer, engineer, or coding genius to run a Code Club.

Even if you're a complete newcomer to coding, you can still volunteer at a Code Club, and doing so is a great way to extend your digital skills.

Using the free step-by-step projects Code Club provides, you can learn to create simple games, animations, and webpages along with your club members.

A great way to prepare for running a Code Club is to complete some projects yourself, and we'll be encouraging you to do that as part of this course.

>*Code Club has definitely shown me that learning new digital skills isn’t hard. If the kids can do it, so can I. Every week, I try out the project we are going to do at the Code Club at home. I’m really enjoying it, and impressed with my own growing coding skills.*
