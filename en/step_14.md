## Week 1 recap — make a to-do list

Well done for completing Week 1! You’re well on your way to getting your Code Club started. Let’s take a look back at what we have covered so far:

+ Welcome and introductions
+ What is a Code Club?
+ Thinking about the location and time of your club
+ How to recruit children and ensure they are safe in your club
+ Hardware and software
+ You used a Code Club project to make a Scratch program!

Next week, we’ll be guiding you through the sessions with your club members step by step. We'll talk about:

+ Using the Code Club projects
+ How to structure your first session
+ How to answer questions

## Task
Write a to-do list of what you need to do, research, or set up before your sessions begin. Then add your list to the comments.

For example, your list might say:

+ Set aside time to plan how often you want the club sessions to run
+ Register on the Code Club website
+ Decide which coding language to start off with in your club

Share your list with other learners on the course by clicking **Join the discussion** below.

You might get some good ideas from someone else’s list which you can add to your own.
