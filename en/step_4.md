## About Code Club


##What is Code Club?
Code Club is a worldwide network of coding clubs for children and young people aged 9â€“13, run by enthusiastic volunteers and educators.

Code Club provides free projects, which are step-by-step guides for children to follow and create animations, games, websites, and much more. When clubs register and activate with us, they get access to exclusive benefits and extra resources for their club, including downloadable certificates and posters.

Code Club was founded in 2012, and is part of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a registered UK charity. Code Club is a key educational programme of the Foundation, working to help young people learn how to build their ideas with code.

We currently have thousands of clubs in more than 100 countries, and our projects have been translated into 25 languages.

##What is a Code Club?
The video in this step gives an example of how one school in Wales is running a Code Club. Code Clubs come in all shapes and sizes, but a typical Code Club takes place once a week for an hour, with around 15 young people participating. Teachers and educators can choose to lead the club by themselves, or with the help of volunteers found in their community or through our website.

Volunteers typically commit to supporting a Code Club for a school term (12 weeks), and spend an hour a week at the club. However, many volunteers run clubs on a more long-term basis, and some even team up with friends or colleagues to share the commitment of volunteering.

In the club sessions, club members follow the instructions in the Code Club projects independently and at their own pace to create something fun and educational with code. Code Club leaders are on hand to set up the sessions and to help the young people to work through the projects.
