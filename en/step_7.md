## Let’s get planning!

Planning is really important for making sure that your Code Club runs smoothly and that the club members enjoy it.

We’ll help you get everything in place in advance, so that once the sessions begin, you can be off to a great start.

If you're a volunteer, it is a good idea to start your planning by talking to a member of staff at the venue where your club will take place. They may already have some ideas about the day, time, and length of the club sessions.

## Venue
The club venue should be a safe place where young people are able to take part in your activity. Code Club works brilliantly in schools, as an extracurricular club for the students to attend.

## Time
Think about what time will suit both the adults running the activity and the young people that attend it.

Code Clubs typically run after school around 15:00, but lunchtime and breakfast clubs all work really well too.

You’ll need to think about the length of the club sessions too. Most Code Clubs run one-hour sessions, as the Code Club projects are designed to take around an hour to complete.

The important thing is to be flexible where possible. That way, you can plan activities that really suit both the club leaders and the young learners who attend.
