## Safeguarding

Above all, it’s essential that the young people in your Code Club are safe. It’s also really important that the adults delivering the activity understand their responsibilities.

If you’re involved in a **Code Club in the UK, Ireland, India or the USA**, read our guidelines on the [Working safely with children page](https://codeclub.org/en/working-with-children){:target="_blank"}.

For Code Clubs around the world (all areas apart from the UK, Ireland, India and the USA), we have created some [general guidelines](https://international.codeclub.org/start-a-club/working-with-children/){:target="_blank"}. You should also make sure that you check the specific safeguarding rules that are in place in your country.

You can also check out this handy [Safeguarding Behaviour Guide](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/downloads.codeclub.org.uk/CodeClubSafeguardingBehaviourGuide.pdf){:target="_blank"}, which has some handy dos and don'ts to remember when you are interacting with young people in your club.

For clubs running online sessions, read our useful safeguarding advice in our [guidance for online sessions](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/clubs/Guidance_on_hosting_online_club_sessions.pdf){:target="_blank"} and on our [‘Ways to run’](https://codeclub.org/en/ways-to-run){:target="_blank"} page.
