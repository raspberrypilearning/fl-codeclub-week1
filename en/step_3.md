## Get Prepared

The best way to learn is by beginning with a plan and a set of objectives.

With this in mind, consider what you hope to achieve and how you will achieve it before we get going.

Think about answering these questions:

- What made you take the course?
- What are you hoping to learn?
- What steps will you take to ensure that you will complete the course? For example: setting aside some 'Do Not Disturb' time in your schedule each week, or inviting a friend to take it with you.
- How will you use and apply the knowledge you take form this course?
