## Introduce Yourself

The best way to learn is by collaborating with other amazing people.

With this in mind, please introduce yourself to your fellow learners by commenting at the bottom of the page.

Think about answering these questions:

- what made you take the course?
- what are you hoping to learn?
- what steps will you take to ensure that you will complete the course? For example: setting aside some 'Do Not Disturb' time in your schedule each week, or inviting a friend to take it with you.
